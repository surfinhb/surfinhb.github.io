        <h1>Shacked</h1>
        <p>Surfing is one of the fastest growing activities in the world with over 30 million participants and is scheduled for the Olympics. However waves are a fickle resource and many surfers live in places where the waves suck 90% of the year.  Naturally, surfers will take any oportunity they can get to escape and find perfect, spitting tubes but picking the right surf destination is always a tricky prospect. Shacked hopes to use geomapping with a slider to aid traveling surfers by giving them a clean visuation that cleary shows where the waves are expected to fire during any month of the year.  When complete the user will be able to pick a month, and have a colored world map display the best "surf regions" using a color hierarchy. They will also be able to choose from factors such as average wave height, quality, and consistency to measure the map allowing anyone from a wavestorm warrior to kelly slater to find their perfect surf destination. </p>
